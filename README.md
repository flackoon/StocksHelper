# StocksHelper ( .NET Core 2.2 Web API + React )

## The database setup

Under Linux, things are a little tricky and in order to get everything running first you execute these in your psql terminal:
- `CREATE DATABASE stockshelper`
- If want to user the username that the Web project expects out of the box, run: `CREATE USER developer WITH PASSWORD 1234`
